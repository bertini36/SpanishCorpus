## Spanish Corpus

This little library needs some packages of _NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)_.
To install these packages is required init a _Python_ console in the _virtualenv_ 
in which the requirements are installed. 
Now enter the command: _nltk.download()_

In the _nltk_ manager you have to ensure that Corpora has installed:
* cess_esp
* omw
* stopwords
* wordnet
* words
And in Models you have to ensure that **Snowball_data** is installed.

Install German and French dictionaries to more accurately:
	_sudo apt-get install myspell-de-de_
 	_sudo apt-get install myspell-fr-fr_

In **main.py** you have an example of the library's use.
